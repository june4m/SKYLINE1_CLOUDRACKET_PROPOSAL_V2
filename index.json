The application is built entirely on an AWS Serverless architecture, integrating technologies such as AI-driven personalized recommendations, sentiment analysis from user reviews, and Google Maps API for locating the nearest courts. It also supports monthly revenue statistics for court owners.\n"},{"uri":"https://june4m.github.io/SKYLINE1_CLOUDRACKET_PROPOSAL_V2/3-problemstatement/","title":"Problem Statement","tags":[],"description":"","content":"What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem? Currently, finding and booking badminton courts mainly relies on manual contact methods (phone or social media). Booking schedules are not updated in real time, and users lack visibility on court coverage and distance estimation. Meanwhile, court owners face difficulties in managing and arranging court schedules as well as generating efficient revenue reports.\nThe Solution This platform automates the entire process of searching, booking, and management for both users and court owners.\nUsers can find courts near their location using Amazon Location Service, view real-time availability through Amazon DynamoDB, and receive personalized recommendations via Amazon Personalize.\nCourt owners can register and update court information, receive automated booking confirmation emails through Amazon SES, and view revenue analytics on a custom dashboard built with AWS Amplify, Lambda, and Chart.js using data from DynamoDB/S3.\nThe web interface is hosted on AWS Amplify with Amazon Cognito handling user authentication.\nBenefits and Return on Investment For Players: Easily find and book suitable courts within seconds, receive personalized recommendations based on behavior and location, and get automated confirmation emails. Court search time is reduced by 90% (from 30 minutes to 3 minutes), and booking confirmation time decreases from 2–24 hours to just 5 minutes.\nFor Court Owners: Automatically manage courts, schedules, and bookings via a centralized dashboard, reducing manual operations by 80%. The system provides visualized reports on revenue, booking frequency, and average ratings to support data-driven decisions.\nFor Developers: Fully serverless architecture ensures minimal operational cost (\u0026lt; $1/month initially, estimated $8–15/month after Free Tier). The system serves as both a practical solution and a valuable learning environment, providing real-world data for research in AI, Vietnamese NLP, and recommendation systems.\n"},{"uri":"https://june4m.github.io/SKYLINE1_CLOUDRACKET_PROPOSAL_V2/4-solutionarchitecture/","title":"Solution Architecture","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The platform adopts an AWS Serverless architecture for stable operations, scalability, and cost efficiency.\nUser, court, and booking data are stored in Amazon DynamoDB. Components communicate via Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions. The web and mobile interfaces are deployed on AWS Amplify, while Amazon Cognito ensures secure access control.\nAmazon Personalize recommends courts based on user history, and Amazon Comprehend performs sentiment analysis on reviews. A Custom Dashboard visualizes operational data for both users and court owners.\nAll activities are monitored through Amazon CloudWatch and automated with Amazon EventBridge.\nAWS Services Used AWS Amplify Hosting: Web/mobile hosting and deployment. Amazon API Gateway: Connects client and backend services. AWS Lambda: Handles business logic and service integration. Amazon DynamoDB: Stores user, court, and booking data. Amazon Cognito: Manages authentication and authorization. Amazon SES: Sends automated booking and notification emails. Amazon S3: Stores court images and analytical data. Amazon Personalize: Provides personalized court recommendations. Amazon Comprehend (Optional): Sentiment analysis on Vietnamese reviews to enhance overall ratings. Amazon Location Service + DynamoDB GeoLib: Finds nearby courts based on user location. Custom Dashboard: Built with AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda, and Chart.js for data visualization using DynamoDB/S3 data. Amplify Admin UI (Admin Portal): Manages CRUD operations for courts, moderates reviews, and tracks logs. Amplify CI/CD: Automates deployment and updates. Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors logs, performance, and alerts. Amazon EventBridge (Scheduler): Automates notifications and data cleanup. AWS IAM + KMS + WAF: Security management, data encryption, and web attack prevention. Component Design User Module: Amazon Cognito manages registration, login, and profiles; user data (bookings, favorites, history) stored in DynamoDB. Court Module: Court owners manage court info and images; data stored in DynamoDB and S3; updates via API Gateway + Lambda. Booking Flow: API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB → SES handles booking, checks conflicts, and sends confirmation emails. Recommendation System: Amazon Personalize analyzes behavior and ratings to suggest courts (70% behavioral + 30% rating-based model). Geo Search: DynamoDB Geo Library or Amazon Location Service locates nearby courts; integrated with Google Maps for directions. Admin Dashboard: Visualizes revenue, bookings, and reviews using AWS Amplify + Chart.js, powered by DynamoDB/S3 data through Lambda. Automation Layer: EventBridge triggers scheduled Lambdas for reminders, retraining models, and data cleanup.
